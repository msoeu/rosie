The cluster is only accessible on the campus network. If you are connecting from a building on campus, you are likely already attached to the campus network.

To access Rosie off campus, you must **first connect to the MSOE VPN**. Download a vpn client and log in with your campus credentials (@msoe.edu address).

## Vpn Clients

On **Windows** or **Mac**, you can download the GlobalProtect client from [vpn.msoe.edu](https://vpn.msoe.edu).

On **Linux**, a popular option is to use an [openconnect fork](https://github.com/yuezk/GlobalProtect-openconnect). Many distributions include openconnect with their default package manager. After you install openconnect, in your terminal execute: `sudo -E gpclient connect --browser default vpn.msoe.edu`. If you find that this is not working, try the prior command with `-no-dtls`.

## Your Rosie Cluster Account

EECS and ROSIE use a separate account management system than the campus network. To request an account, contact the EECS department or the ROSIE SysAdmin.

You will be given a username and a one time password (OTP). **Note: You must log in via shell to reset the OTP before you can use the web portal.**

## Shell Access

Users can directly connect to the management nodes and open a command line interface.

Connect with **ssh** to management node 2, 3, or 4.

```bash
# connect to mgmt2
$ ssh username@dh-mgmt2.hpc.msoe.edu

# connect to mgmt3
$ ssh username@dh-mgmt3.hpc.msoe.edu

# connect to mgmt4
$ ssh username@dh-mgmt4.hpc.msoe.edu
```

### SSH Terminal Program

**Windows** 

The Windows Operating System does not include ssh by default. There are a number of popular options.

* [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) is a classic cross-platofrm solution. Provides users with a ssh terminal login window capable of GUI support. [Getting Started Guide](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.74/htmldoc/Chapter2.html#gs)
* Windows Subsystem for Linux [Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Brings a linux terminal program to the Windows OS.
* Download and install [GIT](https://git-scm.com/). The included git bash terminal program has a ssh command.

**Mac or Linux**

Your operating system includes this by default, yay! Launch terminal and issue `which ssh` to see the location of the ssh program binary file.

Then enter the ssh connect commands above.

*More info about SSH available on the [OpenSSH homepage](https://openssh.com).*

**Note:** Users must activate their account via Shell before being able to access the web terminal.

## Account Activation

![Account Activation Example](_images/ex_activate_steps.png)

1. Use **ssh** to connect to a head management node.
   
Launch your terminal program and input the command (replacing username with your own):

```shell
$ ssh username@dh-mgmt2.hpc.msoe.edu
```

2. The system will prompt for your one time password. Input this to proceed.

3. Re-enter your one time password to begin the password change process.

4. Input your desired password. It is critical to follow healthy password protocol here - the more complicated the more secure.

5. Verify your password by typing it in again.

After inputting your new password twice, the system will permit entry into the management node. You can now close this connecting or explore command line interface with the cluster. You can visit the web portal and login with your username and new password.
